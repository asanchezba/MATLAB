## 8.1. Introduction
<p align="justify">
The study of control systems is required to govern the behaviour of any physical system, where the behaviour can be regarded as the response or the output of that system. In control systems, one of the objectives is to regulate the response with respect to the input of that system. The response of a physical system can be represented mathematically either in the frequency domain or the time domain. The concepts of both of these domains in control systems will be explained in this chapter. To implement the concepts of control systems, it is required to convert any physical system to a mathematical representation. The opposite can also be necessary for various aspects. In this chapter, the concept of state-space representation, which can be used to convert any physical system to a mathematical model, will be demonstrated.
