## Introduction
This chapter explains the basics of linear algebra and presents techniques to solve different algebraic and differential equations. 

### Linear Algebra
**Rank** 
The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. Here, a row or a column vector can be regarded as linearly independent if:

(a) The vector is not a scalar multiple of other vectors.

(b) The vector does not result from the combination of other vectors.

If the dimension of a matrix is _row X col_, the tank of that matrix will be either the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. It can be distinguished more precisely as follows:

(a) If _row > col_, the rank of the matrix &#8801; maximum number of linearly independent columns.

(b) if _row < col_, the rank of the matrix &#8801; maximum number of linearly independent rows.
