## Introduction
This chapter explains the basics of linear algebra, and techniques to solve different algebraic and differential equations are presented. 

### Linear Algebra
**Rank** 
The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. Here, a row or a column vector can be regarded as linearly independent if:

(a) The vector is not a scalar multiple of other vectors

(b) The vector is not a resultant of the combination of other vectors
