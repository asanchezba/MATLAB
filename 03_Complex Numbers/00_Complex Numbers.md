# Complex Numbers

## Introduction
The general form of a complex number is **a + i * b**, where _i_ refers to the imaginary unit, which is represented as i = sqrt(-1). 

### Regular Form
The rectangular form of a complex number can be represented as **C = a + i * b**, where _i_ is the imaginary number, _a_ and _b_ are coefficients and _C_ represent the complex number. In this complex, there are two parts: real and imaginary parts. _a_ represents the real part, whereas _b_ indicates the imaginary part. 
The formula mentioned above can generate the complex number if the real and imaginary values are known. 

### Polar Form
The polar form of any complex number is

Here, |C| is the absolute value or magnitude of the complex number and θ represents the angle. The absolute value is given by |C| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) and the angle is given by θ = b/a rad = (b/a) X 180º/π degree.
