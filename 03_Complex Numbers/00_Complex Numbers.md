# Complex Numbers

### Introduction
The general form of a complex number is **a + ib**, where _i_ refers to the imaginary unit, which is represented as i = sqrt(-1). 
The rectangular form of a complex number can be represented as **C = a + i * b**, where _i_ is the imaginary number, _a_ and _b_ are coefficients and _C_ represent the complex number.
