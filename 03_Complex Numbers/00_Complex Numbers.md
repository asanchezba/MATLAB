# Complex Numbers

## Introduction
The general form of a complex number is **a + i * b**, where _i_ refers to the imaginary unit, which is represented as i = sqrt(-1). 

### Regular Form
The rectangular form of a complex number can be represented as **C = a + i * b**, where _i_ is the imaginary number, _a_ and _b_ are coefficients and _C_ represent the complex number. In this complex, there are two parts: real and imaginary parts. _a_ represents the real part, whereas _b_ indicates the imaginary part. 
The complex number can be generated using the above-mentioned formula if the real and imaginary values are known. 

### Polar Form
The polar form of any complex number is
