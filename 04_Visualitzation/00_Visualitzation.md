### Line plot
A line plot is the most basic and important form of graphics. A 2D line plot can be drawn by the _plot_ command, which offers several features, and user customization options.

```matlab
plot(value,value,'Line Color Line Style Marker','Linewidth',n)
```

The above plot command will plot a 2D line of _xvalue_ vs _yvalue_, and the rest of the features are to self-customise the plot. 

_Liner Color_: The colour of the plotted line can be specified, or MATLAB will use the default colour. There are some commands for the most common colours (Table below).

Apart from the colours mentioned above, MATLAB also supports all combinations of red, green, and blue (RGB) colours, which are represented by a single vector in MATLAB. An RGB colour vector ranges from (0,255) individually. Therefore, a vector of [1 120 230] defines a specific colour; thus, a wide variety of colours can be formed.
