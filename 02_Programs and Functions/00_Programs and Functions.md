# Programs and Functions

### Conditional Statements and Loops

Some important logical and relational operators, meanings, and examples are listed below.

### "If" statement 
It can be represented in three formats:

```matlab
if (logical condition)
  Executable
command...
end
```

```matlab
if (logical condition)
  Executable
command...
    else
  Executable
command...
end
```

```matlab
if (logical condition)
  Executable
command...
    elseif
  Executable
command...
    else
  Executable
command...
end
```
***Example 1***
```matlab
%If statement
clc; clear all

x = randi(20,1);
disp(['The value of x: ', num2str(x)])

if (x > 10)
    disp('x is greater than 10')
end
```
***Example 2***
```matlab
y = randi(100,1);
disp(['The value of y: ', num2str(y)])
%fprintf('The value of y: %d',y)

if (y >= 80)
    disp('Grade: A')
elseif (y >= 60 && y < 80)
    disp('Grade: B')
elseif (y >= 40 && y < 60)
    disp('Grade: C')
else
    disp('Grade: F')
end
```

### "Switch" statement 
Conditional statement through which multiple cases can be set up for executing different blocks of codes. Similar to the _if_ statement but provides more simplicity in terms of comprehension.

```matlab
%Switch structure
switch
  case (Case Expression)
    Executable Statement
 case (Case Expression)
    Executable Statement
..... ......
otherwise
  Executable Statement
end
```

***Example***

```matlab
%Switch statement
clc; clear all

x = input('Enter a month:','s')
switch x
    case 'January'
        disp(['Number of days in ', x, ': 31'])
    case 'February'
        disp(['Number of days in ', x, ': 28'])
    case 'March'
        disp(['Number of days in ', x, ': 31'])
    case 'April'
        disp(['Number of days in ', x, ': 30'])
    case 'May'
        disp(['Number of days in ', x, ': 31'])
    case 'June'
        disp(['Number of days in ', x, ': 30'])
    case 'July'
        disp(['Number of days in ', x, ': 31'])
    case 'August'
        disp(['Number of days in ', x, ': 31'])
    case 'September'
        disp(['Number of days in ', x, ': 30'])
    case 'October'
        disp(['Number of days in ', x, ': 31'])
    case 'November'
        disp(['Number of days in ', x, ': 30'])
    case 'December'
        disp(['Number of days in ', x, ': 31'])
    otherwise
        disp('Enter a correct name of month')
end
```

### "For" loop
It is a repetitive structure, where a certain task will be repeated systematically. This loop performs a set of functions defined by the statements a number of times. Within a for loop, other conditional statements, such as _if_ statement or nested _if_ statement, can be embedded as required.

```matlab
%structure
for index = values
  statements
end
```
***Example***

```matlab
%For loop
clc; clear all

a = [2,4,6,8,10];
for i = 1:length(a)
    fprintf('Iteration: %d\n', i);
    fprintf('Value: %d\n', a(i))
end
```

### User-Defined Functions
Apart from the built-in functions, MATLAB lets the user create a function to carry out a certain task. The user-defined function consists of three parts: input parameters, output variables, and executable commands. This function can be saved as a script file (MATLAB M-file) and used in a separate script file by calling out the functionâ€™s name. Both script files (Function file, Main Script file) need to be in the same directory path. 

Also, MATLAB allows to have another type of user-defined function named Anonymous function, which does not require to be saved as a separate script file. Instead, the function can be created on the same main script file and can be usable in the rest of the code in the same script.

```matlab
%structure

%Function with single input and single output
function out = functionName (input1)
Executable commands for a task
End

%Function with no input and single output
function out = functionName ()
Executable commands for a task
end

%Function with multiple inputs and single output
function out = functionName(input1, input2, ...)
Executable commands for a task
end

%Function with multiple inputs and multiple outputs
function [out1, out2, . . .] = functionName (input1, input2, ...)
Executable commands for a task
end
```
