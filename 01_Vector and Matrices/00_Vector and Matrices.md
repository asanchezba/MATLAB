# Vector and Matrices

### Creating Vectors

A vector can be created using the values enclosed within square brackets, [ ]. A space is used to differentiate among different values. A vector can be a row vector or column vector. In a row vector, the values are separated using space, and semicolons are used among the values in the case of a column vector.

For example, A is a row vector, which contains four values that are separated using space between two neighbouring values. The size of vector A is 1 x 4. B is a column vector, where the values are arranged over a single column. The size of vector B is 4 x 1.

```matlab
% Row vector
A = [1 5 7 9]

% Column vector
B = [1; 5; 7; 9]
```
A vector having values of equal increment or decrement can be defined in an easier way for avoiding enlisting a large number of values manually.

The vector C has three entitiesâ€”the first one is the starting value and the last one is the ending value of the vector. The values are equally spaced and have a +2 increment. The increment value represents the middle entity of the C vector. In case, the increment is +1, the middle entity can be skipped as MATLAB considers +1 as the default increment. For decrement or negative increment, the middle entity will become a negative value.

```matlab
% Row vector with increments
C = 1:2:12

% Row vector with decrements
D = 12:-2:1
```

### Creating Matrices

A matrix can be defined in the same way as a vector and can have multiple rows and columns, based on which its size is determined. The size can be controlled by using space and semicolons. Space indicates a shift from one column to another within a single row, whereas a semicolon represents the end of one row or the start of a new row. The size of any vector is defined by row x column.

```matlab
% Matrix
A = [1 3 5;2 4 3;2 8 4;1 6 9]
```

### Manipulation of vectors and matrices

A matrix can be formed by combining multiple vectors of the same size. After defining a vector or matrix, it is essential to access each value. V1, V2, and V3 represent the values of the first, second, and third rows of M, respectively. A colon (:) is used while accessing multiple values.

```matlab
% Definition of vector 1
V1 = [1 2 5]

% Definition of vector 2
V2 = [4 6 8]

% Definition of vector 3
V3 = [5 7 9]

% Formation of a matrix
M = [V1;V2;V3]

% Accessing a value from the matrix
M(2,3)

% Accessing the values in the first row of every column of matrix M
V1 = M(1, :)

% Accessing the values in the first column of every row of matrix M
V2 = M(:, 1)
```

### Dimensions of matrices

The dimension of a matrix can be determined by _size()_ and is represented by row x column, where row indicates the total number of rows and column refers to the number of columns of that matrix.

```matlab
% Dimension of a matrix
clc; clear;

A = [2, 1; 4, 3; 2, 1]
dim = size(A);
fprintf('Dimension of matrix A:\n');
disp(dim)
```
