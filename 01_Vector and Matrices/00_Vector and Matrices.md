# Vector and Matrices

### Creating Vectors

A vector can be created using the values enclosed within square brackets, [ ]. A space is used to differentiate among different values. A vector can be a row vector or column vector. In a row vector, the values are separated using space, and semicolons are used among the values in the case of a column vector.
